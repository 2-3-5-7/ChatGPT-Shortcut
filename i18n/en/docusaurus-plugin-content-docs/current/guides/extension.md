# Browser Extension

AiShort (ChatGPT Shortcut) is a browser extension compatible with Chrome, Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers. It not only offers features similar to the ChatGPT webpage but also includes additional functionalities like a sidebar and an auto-activation window. The extension can automatically start with ChatGPT or any specified custom page, and also supports manual activation using the `Alt+Shift+S` shortcut.

For users not on Chrome or Edge, or those looking to experience the latest features, the development version of the extension is available for download at: [Development Version Download](https://github.com/rockbenben/ChatGPT-Shortcut/releases).

For users not utilizing Chrome-based browsers, we offer a Tampermonkey script — [**ChatGPT Shortcut Anywhere**](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/482907-chatgpt-shortcut-anywhere) — that enables you to use the AiShort sidebar feature. Please note that due to restrictions on script content injection on the ChatGPT page, you can only activate the sidebar feature on the ChatGPT website by installing our extension. The Tampermonkey script, however, functions normally on other websites.

## Language Options

ChatGPT Shortcut supports 13 major languages, and the extension language will be automatically set based on your browser environment. The language of the built-in ChatGPT page and sidebar within the extension will also follow this setting. To avoid triggering third-party website permission alerts, it is advised not to switch languages directly on embedded pages.

## Display Settings

### AiShort Sidebar

When the AiShort sidebar is enabled, it will automatically activate when visiting specified web pages. You can also manually activate it using the green icon at the bottom right of the page. The sidebar is currently supported on ChatGPT, Bard, Claude, and Wenxin Yiyan. To use the AiShort sidebar on other websites, install the [ChatGPT Shortcut Anywhere](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/482907-chatgpt-shortcut-anywhere) script.

### Built-in Homepage

With the built-in homepage feature enabled, a button will appear in the top left corner of the ChatGPT web version. Clicking this button will replace the ChatGPT application interface with the AiShort page.

## Independent Window Mode

When the independent window mode is enabled, the extension interface will persistently display as a separate window, facilitating multitasking. You can set auto-activation websites in the extension settings so that the AiShort window will automatically activate when the browser visits these sites.
